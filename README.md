# minishell1
This is an simple basic interactive UNIX shell.
## Getting Started
clone the repo and run the makefile (just tap "make" on your terminal). Next, you only have to run "./mysh" for the interactive shell, or "echo "ls -l" | ./mysh for a non-tty mode.
### Prerequisites
You need to be on an UNIX system (or equivalent) to run it.
